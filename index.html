        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi all and welcome to my website! I'm a Robotics, Autonomous and Interactive Systems undergrad at Heriot-Watt University, Scotland.
            During my studies I have developed a passion for software development, particularly using Java and C, and I am a big fan of Linux. I'm looking forward 
            to developing my skills and showcasing my projects on this website. Below you can find links to my Github, LinkedIn, and my email.

                <h4>AVR Piezo Musical Instrument</h4>
            
                Last year I built a simple musical instrument that would play notes from a buzzer depending on which button was
                pressed. I just did it for fun as I had a few pieces lying around.
                I really enjoyed programming an actual project outside of university, and I learned how to add my own header
                files and how to build files in the terminal as I didn't use an IDE.
                You can see more details at its <a href="https://github.com/EDowds98/avr-piezo-piano">repository.</a>

                <h4>A Simple Stack in C</h4>
                
                I was enjoying learning about Data Structures and Algorithms in University so I thought I'd implement a simple Stack. 
                I am using it as an opportunity to practise using structs and pointers to functions in C to program a little more OOPly.
                I'm finding that it helps me appreciate OOP programming a bit more, although I do how elegant a solution pointers are to problems.
                Once again the details are in its <a href="https://github.com/EDowds98/DataAlgoInC">repository</a>
